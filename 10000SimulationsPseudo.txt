function demand():
    copies the original weekly demand to the correct cell(can be changed so that there is fluctuation)
    for loop i,  0 - 51
        row = goes through every 7 rows
        col = Weekly demand column (does not change), index of output cell
        outputCell = originalDemand * change , in our case change is 1

    copies the original weekly demand to the correct cell(can be changed so that there is fluctuation)
